# Automated Military Engineers [Civilization VI Mod]

Enhances Military Engineers with a new mini-UI that allows the player to automate their Military Engineer actions.

Currently the only action supported is to connect the player's own cities with Railroads.

#### Special thanks

This mod is heavily based on the *AutoBuilders* mod by *Adriaman* and *MadManCam*, and this project would not be possible without it.
